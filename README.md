## Error Handling

The application uses a centralized error handler to catch and respond with appropriate error messages. Hereâ€™s an example error response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation Error",
  "errorMessages": [
    {
      "path": "email",
      "message": "Email is required"
    }
  ],
  "stack": "Error stack trace (only in development mode)"
}
```

### Not Found Route

For any unmatched routes, the API responds with a 404 error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Not Found"
}
```
